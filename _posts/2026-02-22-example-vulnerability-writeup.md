This is a mock blog post. Replace this content with your actual vulnerability writeup.

## Summary

Brief one-paragraph description of the vulnerability, its impact, and the affected software.

## Affected Versions

| Version Range | Status |
|---|---|
| v1.0.0 - v2.3.1 | Vulnerable |
| v2.3.2+ | Fixed |

## Technical Details

Describe the root cause of the vulnerability here. Reference specific files and line numbers.

The vulnerable code pattern looked like this:

```python
# Example vulnerable code
command = f"some_tool {user_input}"
os.system(command)  # No sanitization!
```

## Proof of Concept

Step-by-step reproduction instructions.

### Step 1: Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/acme-project.git
cd acme-project
```

### Step 2: Create the exploit payload

```python
# Example exploit script
payload = "; id ; #"
run_vulnerable_function(payload)
```

### Step 3: Observe the result

```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Impact

Describe the real-world impact:

- **Confidentiality:** Attacker can read secrets and sensitive data
- **Integrity:** Attacker can modify build artifacts
- **Availability:** Attacker can disrupt CI/CD pipelines

## Remediation

Describe the recommended fix:

```python
# Fixed code - use list arguments, no shell=True
subprocess.run(["some_tool", user_input], shell=False)
```
